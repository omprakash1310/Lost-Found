# *Find&Earn: Lost and Found Platform*

*Welcome to Find&Earn*, a decentralized platform where users can report and find lost items securely and transparently using blockchain technology. This platform leverages smart contracts to ensure that lost items can be reported, notifications can be sent to users, and rewards can be claimed—all in a decentralized environment.



## *Technologies Used*

- *Solidity*: Smart contract programming language for developing the decentralized application (DApp).
- *React*: Frontend JavaScript library for building a dynamic, interactive UI.
- *Ether.js*: Library used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from the frontend.
- *Hardhat*: Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

## *Key Features*

- *Report Lost Items*: Users can report lost items and offer a reward in cryptocurrency.
- *Mark Item as Found*: When an item is found, the finder can mark it as found, notifying the reporter.
- *Claim Reward*: Reporters can claim a reward once they confirm the item is found.
- *Notifications*: Users receive notifications about the status of their lost items and potential finders.
- *Transparency & Security*: Blockchain ensures fair transactions and transparency in all interactions.

## *Deployment Note*

⚠ *MVP and Hackathon Stage*: This project is currently in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and Hackathon stage. The smart contract functionalities have been deployed on the Core testnet for demonstration and testing purposes. Due to time constraints, we have focused on showcasing the core features. A more robust backend system and real-time data synchronization would be needed for full-scale deployment.
